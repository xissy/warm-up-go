# warm-up-go
> warm up coding with golang

### Why?
I have always wanted to be a good, productive, motivated, and effective programmer. Once I start to code on my computer, I can keep focusing for a while more than four hours usually. But what I struggle with is sometimes I cannot start my work. I don't know why, but it was difficult to open my IDE and start to write codes on it. (because I am not a robot?)

### Solution
So here is my solution. I don't start working immediately when I open my code editor. Instead, I look around my interested code repos and just type-down a code snippet from one of great open-sourced code repos as a warm-up.

### Benefits
* It enables me to be in the zone, a.k.a. flow, more easily.
* I can read code snippets that teach me a lot about a better design, trick, tweak, optimization, testing, or debugging.
* I can automatically imagine how to adopt those good techniques into my projects, it helps me to be a better programmer and to avoid pitfalls of new technologies.

### So far
So good. A no-brainer solution for a lazy programmer.
